/***********************
 * 
 * I2C protocol for reading measurements from a remote esp32
 * 
 * 0. Set parameters
 * - Duration between scans
 * - Sleep mode with auto-wakeup timeout
 * - Request new scan, irrespective of duration between scans
 * 
 * Write
 * Byte 0: request code 0x81
 * Byte 1-4: set duration between scans, in millis
 * Byte 5-8: >0 for sleep mode, indicates auto-wakeup timeout in millis
 * Byte 9: Bit 0: 1 for requesting new scan, else 0.
 * 
 * Followed by a read:
 * Byte 0: Version of response.
 *      1: Version 1, follows what's described here. Next versions can only have longer lengths.
 * 8 bytes (to keep some forward compatibility)
 * Byte 0: Version of esp32 remote
 * 
 * 
 * 1. Write config data to remote esp32
 * 
 * Write
 * Byte 0: request code 0x01
 * Byte 1: type of device
 *     #define BLE_DEVICE_NOT_SPECIFIED 0
 *     #define BLE_DEVICE_LYWSDCGQ 1
 *     #define BLE_DEVICE_LYWSD03MMC_PVVX 2
 *     Others: to be defined.
 *     If BLE_DEVICE_NOT_SPECIFIED, the matching of device scan data is supposed to determine device type.
 * Bytes 2 - 7: MAC address of BLE device
 * Only public MAC addresses are used
 * 
 * The call can be repeated to indicate multiple addresses. (Currently not implemented,
 * a single address is remembered)
 * The list of addresses is limited in length to 50 entries (old entries are purged),
 * and does not survive a reboot.
 * The last written MAC address is the one whose data will be read with a read
 * measurements call.
 * 
 * 
 * 2. Read the available measurements
 * 
 * First write config data, for MAC address to get measures from.
 * Then read. One read for each writing of config data.
 * 
 * The remote esp32 will perform BLE scan every 5 minutes. Received data
 * will correspond to the latest scan result (or 99999 values if the scan
 * hasn't been performed yet.)
 * 
 * Read 1 byte
 * Byte 0: number of available measures
 * 
 * Read N * 5 bytes, N == number of available measures. Each measure is:
 * Byte 0: type of measure
 *     1: temp, in 1/1000 Â°C
 *     2: humidity, in 1/100 of %
 *     3: batteryPct, in 1/100 of %
 *     4: batteryVoltage, in mV
 * Byte 1 - 4: value, int32_t, lsb first
 *
